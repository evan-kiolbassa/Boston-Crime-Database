# Boston-Crime-Database
This repository shows the development of a PostgreSQL database for the open source dataset
"Boston Crimes." The database is for educational purposes only. The database was constructed 
in the Python shell environment using the psycopg2 library, which allows interaction between
Python and PostgreSQL. Preliminary EDA was performed using the Jupyter Notebook IDE.
